# Project 9: Number Guessing Project
## Description:
A fun and interactive number-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within 
a specified range. The game offers two difficulty levelsâ€”Easy and Hardâ€”each with a different number of attempts.

### Features:
- Random number generation within a range (1 to 100).
- Two difficulty levels: Easy (10 attempts) and Hard (5 attempts).
- User-friendly inputs with error handling for invalid guesses.
- Feedback provided for each guess (e.g., too high, too low).
- Modular design with separate functions for key tasks.
- A welcoming and interactive interface with clear instructions.
