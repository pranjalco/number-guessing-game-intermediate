# Project 9: Number Guessing Project

## Description:
A fun and interactive number-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within 
a specified range. The game offers two difficulty levels—Easy and Hard—each with a different number of attempts.

## How to Play:
1. Start the Game: Run the program to begin the Number Guessing Game. You'll be greeted with a welcome message 
                   and instructions.  
2. Pick a Difficulty Level: Choose between two difficulty levels:  
   - Easy: You get 10 attempts to guess the number.  
   - Hard: You get 5 attempts to guess the number.  
3. Guess the Number: The program will prompt you to input a number between 1 and 100.  
4. Get Feedback: After each guess, you'll receive feedback:  
   - Too low: The guessed number is smaller than the target number.  
   - Too high: The guessed number is larger than the target number.  
   - Correct: If you guess the number correctly, you win the game!  
5. Attempts Management: Keep guessing until:  
   - You run out of attempts, or  
   - You guess the correct number.  
6. Game Over Message: If you use all your attempts without guessing correctly, the game will reveal the number and 
                      wish you luck for the next time!
